title: "CogniCrypt - Secure Integration of Cryptographic Software"
---

A large number of recent studies have shown that most software applications that use cryptographic procedures misuse them in an unsafe manner. The VeraCode Report <a href="https://www.veracode.com/state-software-security-2017" target="_blank">State of the Software Security 2017</a> lists the unsafe use of cryptography as the second most common cause of software vulnerabilities, right after data leakage.

Eclipse CogniCrypt was developed within the collaborative research center CROSSING of  Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. It allows developers to quickly identify and fix security-critical misuses of crytographic libraries.
